# Meowwright Improvement Tasks

This document contains a prioritized list of tasks to improve the Meowwright test automation framework. Each task is marked with a checkbox that can be checked off when completed.

## Project Setup and Configuration

1. [x] Add proper project description, author, and other metadata to package.json
2. [x] Configure npm scripts for common operations (test, lint, report, etc.)
3. [x] Set up ESLint and Prettier for code quality and consistent formatting
4. [x] Configure TypeScript properly with strict type checking
5. [x] Implement dotenv for environment variable management (uncomment and configure in playwright.config.ts)
6. [x] Create a comprehensive README.md with project overview, setup instructions, and usage examples
7. [x] Set up a CI/CD pipeline configuration for Google Cloud Build (cloudbuild.yaml)
8. [x] Expand .gitignore to cover more common exclusions (logs, environment files, etc.)

## Architecture and Design

9. [x] Create a more robust fixture system that can handle multiple page objects
10. [x] Implement a centralized configuration management system for test data and environments
11. [x] Develop a logging strategy beyond simple console.log statements
12. [x] Create utility classes for common operations (string manipulation, date handling, etc.)
13. [ ] Implement API testing capabilities alongside UI testing
14. [x] Design a reporting strategy with custom reporters or enhanced HTML reports
15. [x] Create a test data management strategy (factories, fixtures, etc.)
16. [ ] Implement visual testing capabilities

## Page Object Model Enhancements

17. [x] Enhance BasePage with more common functionality (waitForElement, isElementVisible, etc.)
18. [ ] Add proper JSDoc documentation to all page classes and methods
19. [x] Implement component objects for reusable UI components
20. [ ] Create stronger typing for page elements and selectors
21. [ ] Add validation methods to page objects
22. [ ] Implement chainable methods for better readability
23. [x] Add logging and error handling to page object methods
24. [ ] Create a strategy for handling dynamic elements and content

## Test Structure and Organization

25. [ ] Organize tests by feature/functionality rather than just by page
26. [ ] Implement proper test tagging for categorization and selective execution
27. [ ] Create test utilities for common assertions and conditions
28. [ ] Implement proper test data separation from test logic
29. [ ] Add proper assertions to existing tests (many are missing assertions)
30. [ ] Create test hooks for common setup/teardown operations
31. [ ] Implement parallel test execution strategy
32. [ ] Add retry logic for flaky tests

## Browser and Environment Configuration

33. [ ] Enable and configure multiple browser testing (Firefox, WebKit)
34. [ ] Set up mobile device testing configurations
35. [ ] Configure different environments (dev, staging, prod)
36. [ ] Implement cross-browser visual comparison testing
37. [ ] Configure proper screenshot and video capture settings
38. [ ] Set up performance testing capabilities

## Documentation and Knowledge Sharing

39. [ ] Create architectural documentation explaining the framework design
40. [ ] Document coding standards and best practices
41. [ ] Create tutorials for adding new tests and page objects
42. [ ] Document common issues and troubleshooting steps
43. [ ] Create API documentation for the framework's core classes
44. [ ] Document the reporting system and how to interpret results

## Performance and Optimization

45. [ ] Optimize test execution speed
46. [ ] Implement smart waiting strategies to reduce flakiness
47. [ ] Configure proper resource caching
48. [ ] Optimize CI/CD pipeline execution
49. [ ] Implement test parallelization strategies
50. [ ] Configure proper resource cleanup after tests

## Security and Best Practices

51. [ ] Implement secure credential management
52. [ ] Add security testing capabilities
53. [ ] Ensure no sensitive data is logged or stored in reports
54. [ ] Implement dependency scanning and updates
55. [ ] Configure proper access controls for test environments
